Three lanes
All are the same
Clearly has defined stages like all card games

    Rez any heroes that can and  let the player choose where they go
    Add two random creeps to two random lanes
    Draw cards at top of round
        Refreash Mana between lanes
        then improvments trigger
        Players take actions one after another
        May play cards in any of the three rounds at a time
        Preforming any action(playing cards) passes the cards over to the next person
        If both players "pass" then all cards fight
        goto: Card to Card Battle
    End of round goto shopping phase

Card to Card Battle:
    All cards in a lane attack the card across from each other(this is not fully true, "bend cards exsist")
    Cards to damage to each other when they fight
    If a cards health is below zero at the end of that they die, granting the other person gold
    Damage not blocked by a character is taken by the tower

Tower Rules
    Health Starts at 40, if it drops below 0 prevent all other damage taken that turn and increased health to 80
